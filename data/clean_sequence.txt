marshall|-|(who's your daddy?) i don't know him, but i wonder|-|(is he rich like me?) ha-ha|-|(has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)|-|no! if he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad|-|i wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad|-|i'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens|-|when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and|-|makes you want to get up and start dancing, even if it is charles manson|-|who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing|-|laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my k-mart mansion|-|i'm in the style department with a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart|-|with great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content|-|completely, despondent and condescending, the king of nonsense|-|and controversy is on a, beat killing spree, your honor, i must, plea, guilty|-|cause i sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause|-|who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level, boost it|-|but several rebuked it, and whoever produced it|-|(hip hop is the devil's music) is that me? it belongs to me?|-|cause i just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns|-|that don't honk but every time i speak you, hear a beep?|-|but lyrically i never hear a peep, not even a whisper|-|rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the...|-|it's the time of the season, when hate runs high|-|and this time, give it to you easy, when i take back what's mine|-|with pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan|-|my job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing|-|(what's your name?) shady|-|(who's your daddy?) i don't give a fuck, but i wonder|-|(is he rich like me?) doubt it, ha|-|(has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)|-|so, yeah, dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk|-|but i bet we probably wouldn't get one block|-|without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault|-|maybe that's why i'm always so bananas, i appeal to all those walks|-|of like, whoever had strife, maybe that's what dad and son talks are like|-|cause i, related to the struggles of young america|-|when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles|-|now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical|-|i chuckle, cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh|-|better beware knuckleheads, the sound of my hustle says don't knock|-|the doors broken, it won't lock, it might just fly open, get cold cocked|-|you critics come pay me a visit, misery loves company, please stay a minute|-|kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it|-|too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks|-|then you wonder why i lash out, mister mathers as advertised on the flyers|-|so spread the word cause i'm promoting my passion til i'm passed out|-|a completely brain dead rainman, going a bankhead in a restraint chair|-|so bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare|-|or get shanked in the pancreas, i'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer|-|put together with chief keef cause i hate every fucking thing, yeah|-|even this rhyme, bitch|-|and quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there|-|but i still am a criminal|-|ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals|-|the last mathers lp that went diamond|-|this time i'm predicting this one will go emerald|-|when will the madness end, how can it when|-|there's no method to the pad and pen|-|the only message that i have to sing is: dad, i'm back at it again, bitchyou fucking groupie... pick up the goddamn phone|-|bitch, where the fuck were you tuesday? with who you say?|-|i wasn't at the studio bitch, what'd you do screw dre?|-|you went there looking for

single sailor for the night, bitch on a scale of, 1 to 10|-|shit, i must be the holy grail of, catches|-|ho, i got an oscar attached to my fucking name, de la|-|i might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor made for me|-|say fuck it kick some shots back, get hammered and nail her|-|these bitches tryna get attached but they're failing to latch onto the tail|-|of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer|-|like i'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, i'm rich as a bitch|-|but bitches ain't shit, i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch|-|bitch you complain when you listen to

much better|-|i'm just playing bitch, you know i love youthis is survival of the fittest|-|this is do or die|-|this is the winner takes it all|-|so take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all|-|wasn't ready to be no millionaire, i was ill-prepared|-|i was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there|-|from the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends|-|it was 'bout busting raps and standing for something - fuckin' acronym|-|cut the fucking act like you're happy, i'm fucking back again|-|with another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end|-|it ain't over 'til i say it's over - enough when i say enough|-|throw me to them wolves and close the gate up|-|i'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought|-|of being thrown into an alligator pit, i salivate at it, wait is up|-|hands up

line that i finish|-|i'm so close to my goals, i can almost pole vault over the goal post|-|and if i don't got enough in the tank, maybe i can just siphon enough|-|to fill up this last can, man will i survive in this climate or what?|-|they said i was washed up, and got a blood bath|-|i'm not a rapper, i'm an adapter - i can adjust|-|plus, i can just walk up to a mic and just bust|-|so, floor's open if you'd like to discuss|-|top 5 in this mothafucka and if i don't make the cut, what?|-|like i give a fuck but i light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck|-|through the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it|-|like g-unit without the hyphen, i'm hyping 'em up|-|and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut|-|and i look like i might just give up, eh, might've mistook|-|me for bowing out i ain't taking a bow, i'm stabbing myself|-|with a fucking knife in the gut, while i'm wiping my butt|-|cause i just shitted on the mic and i like getting cut|-|i get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut|-|cause i'mma fight 'til i die or win, biting the dust, it'll just make me angrier|-|wait, let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting|-|now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut|-|it's survival of what?|-|this is survival of the fittest|-|this is do or die|-|this is the winner takes it all|-|so

it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit|-|live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this|-|refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick|-|if i don't do this music shit, i'll lose my shit|-|ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth|-|it's all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in a booth, i spit|-|but my respect is overdue, i'm showing you the flow no one do|-|cause i don't own no diploma for school, i quit|-|so there's nothing for me to fall back on, i know no other trade|-|so you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es|-|cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me|-|so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers|-|but i want you to doubt me, i don't want you to buh-lieve|-|cause this is something that i must use to succeed|-|and if you don't like me then fuck you|-|self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me|-|my skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me|-|i can see why the fuck i disgust you|-|i must be allergic to failure, cause everytime i come close to it|-|i just sneeze but i just go atchoo then a-chieve!|-|this is survival of the fittest|-|this is do or die|-|this is

matter if it's true|-|i'll say it all for you|-|i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling|-|why am i so differently wired? am i a martian?|-|what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in|-|because i don't belong in this world|-|that's why i'm scoffing at authority, defying often|-|flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad|-|so i'm non complying at home, at school i'm just shy and awkward|-|and no i don't need no goddamn psychologist|-|trynna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems|-|thinking he can try and solve them|-|i'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk|-|and in the front drive talking to myself|-|either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet|-|trying not to be noticed because i'm crying and sobbing|-|i had a bad day at school so i ain't talking|-|some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker|-|and he said that i eyeballed him|-|and if you fall, i'll get you there|-|i'll be your savior from|-|all the wars that are fought|-|inside your world|-|please have faith in my words|-|'cause this is my legacy, legacy, here|-|this is my legacy, legacy, here|-|there's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see|-|this is my legacy, legacy|-|legacy, legacy|-|i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling|-|why am i so differently wired in my nogging?|-|'cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling|-|'cause i obsess on everything and my mind is small shit|-|bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split|-|but i don't give a shit i'm fine as long as|-|there's batteries in my walkman nothing is the matter with me|-|shit look at the bright side at least i ain't walking|-|i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment|-|complex on a ten speed which i've acquired parts that i|-|found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it|-|headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit|-|but if this is all there is for me life offers|-|why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense|-|but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience|-|what about those rhymes i've been jottin'|-|they are kinda giving me confidence|-|instead of tryina escape through my comics,|-|why don't i just blast a little something like onyx|-|to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that|-|say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him|-|grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch|-|who would've knew from the moment i turned the mic on|-|i could be iconic, and my conquest is|-|is word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest|-|this is my legacy, legacy, here|-|this is my legacy, legacy, here|-|there's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see|-|this is my legacy, legacy|-|legacy, legacy|-|i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling|-|now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome|-|'cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work|-|words like this and connect lines like crosswords|-|and use my enemy's words as strength|-|to try and draw from, and get inspired off em|-|'cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit|-|by you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit|-|now you shut up bitch, i am talking|-|thought i was full of horseshit and now|-|you fucking worship the ground in which i am walking|-|me against the world so what? i'm brian dawkins|-|versus the whole 0 and 16 lions offense|-|so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins|-|it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplying coffins|-|'cause

dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass|-|and a flying saucer full of italian sausage|-|the most high exalting and i ain't halting|-|till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes|-|the best part about me is i am not you|-|i am me, i'm a fire marshall and this is my|-|legacy, legacy, here|-|this is my legacy, legacy, here|-|there's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see|-|this is my legacy, legacy|-|legacy, legacyi came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain|-|an asshole, that role i think i succeed in fulfilling|-|but don't think i ever stopped|-|to think i was speaking to children|-|everything was happening so fast|-|it was like i blinked, sold three million|-|then it all went blank, all i remember|-|is feeling ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feeling|-|like i am always under attack man|-|i could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling|-|women dish him but really thinking|-|if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him|-|guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite|-|when i'm ripping shit, but since when did this many|-|people ever give a shit but i had to say|-|it's just my opinion|-|if it contradicts how i'm living|-|put a dick in your rear end and guess what|-|every time you mention a lyric, i thank you for it|-|for drawing more attention toward it|-|cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude|-|thought i was that important|-|but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect|-|and battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid|-|attaboy, they told me to slow down, and i just zone out|-|good luck trying to convince a blonde|-|that's like telling gwen stefan' that she sold out|-|cause i was tryna leave, no doubt|-|in anyone's mind one day i'd go down|-|in history think they know now|-|because everybody knows|-|everybody knows that you're just an asshole|-|everywhere that you go, people wanna go|-|"oh, everyone knows"|-|everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice|-|there's no place you can hide|-|you are just an asshole|-|everyone knows, everyone knows|-|thanks for the support, asshole [*scratch*] thanks for the support, asshole|-|quit acting salty, i was

counter|-|i fell but the fans caught me, and now|-|you're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me|-|to take my belt, word to pacquiao|-|momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about|-|gotta go in that ring and knock them out|-|or you better not come out|-|it's poetry in motion, like freddie roach when he's quoting shakespeare|-|so what if the insults are revolting|-|even helen keller knows life stinks|-|you think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled|-|but you should give little shit what i think|-|this whole world is a mess|-|gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a glock|-|just to go out watch batman|-|who needs a test to test the testicles, not that man|-|half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage|-|rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model|-|before they put

masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)|-|cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god|-|all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod|-|now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box|-|let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard|-|everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got|-|well, to be truthful the blueprint's|-|simply rage and youthful exuberance|-|everybody loves to root for a nuisance|-|hit the earth like an asteroid|-|did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew)|-|mc's get taken to school with this music|-|cause i use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"|-|now i lead a new school full of students|-|me? i'm a product of rakim, lakim shabazz, 2pac|-|n.w.a, cube, hey, doc, ren, yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim|-|inspired enough to one day grow up|-|blow up and be in a position|-|to meet run-d.m.c|-|and induct them into the mothafuckin' rock 'n|-|roll hall of fame|-|even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames|-|only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame|-|on the wall of (shame)|-|you fags think it's all a game, 'til i walk a flock of flames|-|off a plank and|-|tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?|-|little gay-lookin boy|-|so gay i can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy|-|you're witnessing a mass-occur|-|like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy|-|oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy|-|you get a thumbs up, pat on the back|-|and a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy|-|hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy|-|i get a "hell yeah" from dre, looking boy|-|i'ma work for|-|everything i have, never ask nobody for shit|-|get outta my face, looking boy|-|basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up|-|with the same pace, looking boy|-|cause i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god|-|all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod|-|the way i'm racing around the track, call me nascar, nascar|-|dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god|-|kneel before general zod this planet's krypton no asgard, asgard|-|so you be thor and i'll be odin, you rodent, i'm omnipotent|-|let off then i'm reloading immediately with these bombs i'm toting|-|and i should not be woken|-|i'm the walking dead|-|but i'm just a talking head, a zombie floating|-|but i got your mom deep throating|-|i'm out my ramen noodle|-|we have nothing in common, poodle|-|i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil|-|it's me|-|my honesty's brutal|-|but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though|-|for good at least once in a while|-|so i wanna make sure somewhere|-|in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle|-|enough rhymes to|-|maybe try to help get some people through tough times|-|but i gotta keep a few punchlines|-|just in case cause even you unsigned|-|rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime|-|i know there was a time where once i, was king of the underground|-|but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind|-|so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine|-|appeal with the skin color of mine|-|you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line|-|i said on "i'm back" from the mathers lp 1|-|when i tried to say|-|"i'll take seven kids from columbine|-|put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a nine"|-|see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm|-|morphin' into an immortal|-|coming through the portal|-|you're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though|-|and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for|-|you're pointless as rapunzel with fucking|-|cornrows|-|you write normal? fuck being normal|-|and i just bought a new raygun from the future|-|just to come and shoot ya, like when fabolous made ray j mad|-|cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad|-|singing to a man while they played piano|-|man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel|-|so ray j went straight to the radio station|-|the very next day, "hey fab, i'ma kill you!"|-|lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad)|-|uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming i'm a human|-|what i gotta do to get it through to you? i'm superhuman|-|innovative and i'm made of rubber|-|so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and|-|i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating|-|how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating|-|never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting|-|for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating|-|cause i know the way to get 'em motivated|-|i make elevating music, you make elevator music|-|"oh, he's too mainstream"|-|well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it|-|"it's not hip-hop, it's pop"|-|cause i found a, hella way to fuse it|-|with rock, shock rap with doc|-|throw on "lose yourself" and make 'em lose it|-|"i don't know how to make songs like that|-|i don't know what words to use"|-|let me know when it occurs to you|-|while i'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you|-|it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurting you|-|how many verses i gotta murder to|-|prove that if you were half as nice|-|your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?|-|ungh, school flunky, pill junkie|-|but look at the accolades, these skills brung me|-|full of myself, but still hungry|-|i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to|-|and i'm a million leagues above you|-|ill when i speak in tongues|-|but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you|-|i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel|-|i'm asleep in the front seat|-|bumping heavy d and the boyz|-|still "chunky but funky"|-|but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling|-|angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me|-|they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate|-|but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have|-|then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic|-|to the situation and understand the discrimination|-|but fuck it|-|life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then|-|but if i can't batter the women|-|how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?|-|don't mistake him for satan|-|it's a fatal mistake|-|if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation|-|to trip abroad|-|and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard|-|be a king? think not|-|why be a king when you can be a god?or eminem has a full line of chainsaws|-|eminem, eminem, eminem, eminem|-|eminem, eminem|-|marshall mathers, eminem, the rapper eminem|-|who can say for sure?|-|perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer|-|if science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use|-|society will reap a great benefit|-|i walk around like a space cadet, place your bets|-|who's likely to become a serial killer? case of tourette's|-|fuck! fuck! fuck! can't take the stress|-|i make a mess as the day progresses|-|angry and take it out on the neighbours hedges|-|like this is how i'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimming scisors with razor edges|-|imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, i guess|-|'cause i feel like a little bitch's, predicaments, despicable|-|i'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous|-|i look like a freaking wuss, a pussy|-|this kid just took my stick of liquorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush|-|i wanna kick his toosh, but i was six and shook|-|this fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook|-|he hit me, i fell, i got back up, all i did was book, now there's using your head|-|mama always said|-|"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"|-|a brain you'd be dangerous|-|(mama could be wrong)|-|mama, i'ma grow a name and be famous|-|and i'mma be a pain in the anus|-|(mama could be wrong)|-|i'mma use my head as a weapon|-|find a way to escape this insaneness|-|(mama always said)|-|"son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"|-|guess it pays to be brainless|-|fast forward some years later: a teenager|-|this is a fun, sweet! i just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete|-|it's usually once a month, this is some feat i've accomplished|-|they've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stomped me|-|but how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat|-|when you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life|-|chance to make it or succeed 'cause you're doomed from the start|-|it's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street|-|but if i had just kept my head up my ass|-|i could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance|-|locked in my room, yeah but i got some plans mama|-|these damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, i can't stop it|-|and i'm starting to blend in more, school, this shit helps for sure|-|i'm getting more self assured than i've ever been before|-|plus no one picks on me anymore, i done put a stop to that|-|threw my first punch, end of story|-|still in my skulls a vacant, empty void|-|been using it more as a bin for storage|-|take some inventory and as gorge as a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword|-|not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore|-|everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain|-|like an independent store, something's wrong with my head|-|just think if i had a brain in it, thank god that i don't|-|'cause i'd probably be dahmer|-|'cause mama always said|-|"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"|-|a brain you'd be

insaneness|-|(mama always said)|-|"son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"|-|guess it pays to be brainless|-|now my mom goes "womp, womp, womp"|-|'cause i'm not that smart but i'm not dumb|-|i was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped|-|but somehow, i came out on top|-|i told you one day, i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo|-|i'm nice, yo, fuck it i'm out cold|-|now everywhere i go, they scream out "go!"|-|i'm 'bout to clean house, yo|-|i'm lysol, now i'm just household|-|outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out|-|middle america, hear them yell out|-|they were so scared, and those kids|-|just about, belted out, whatever spout that it fell out|-|of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird|-|inappropriate, so be it, i don't see it|-|maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as|-|motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, till then|-|hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards|-|it's okay to be scared straight, they said i provoke queers|-|till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius|-|smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah|-|you motherfuckin' - insert insult here -|-|who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone mc would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it|-|and boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked|-|this hip-hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got that white trash traffic and gridlock|-|shit happened like a six blocks from a kid rock insane clown posse concert in mid oc-tober|-|and got forbid i see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog|-|'cause i turn into the unabomber|-|mama always said|-|"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"|-|a brain you'd be dangerous|-|(mama could be wrong)|-|mama, i'ma grow a name and

dangerous"|-|guess it pays to be brainless|-|insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck|-|neither is ain'tyou used to say that i'd never be|-|nothing without you and i'd believe|-|i'm shot in the lungs, i gasp, i can't breathe|-|just lay here with me, baby, hold me please|-|and i'd beg and i'd plead, drop to knees|-|and i'd cry and i'd scream, "baby, please don't leave"|-|snatch the keys from your hand, i would squeeze|-|and you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me|-|and you must hate me|-|why do you date me, if you say i make you sick?|-|and you've had enough of me|-|i smother you, i'm 'bout to jump off the edge|-|but you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than i was|-|before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you|-|and if i stumble, i won't crumble, i'll get back up and uhh|-|but i'mma still be humble when i scream "fuck you"|-|cause i'm stronger than i was|-|a beautiful face is all that you have|-|cause on the inside you're ugly and mad|-|but you're all that i love, i grasp, you can't leave|-|please stay here with me, baby hold me please|-|and i'd beg and i plead, drop to knees|-|and i'd cry and i'd scream, baby, please don't leave|-|but you left and you took everything i had left|-|and left nothing, nothing for me|-|so please don't wake me from this dream, baby|-|we're still together in my head|-|and you're still in love with me|-|'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead|-|but you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than i was|-|before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you|-|and if i stumble, i won't crumble, i'll get back up and uhh|-|but i'mma still be humble when i scream "fuck you"|-|cause i'm stronger than i was|-|you walked out, i almost died, it was almost a homicide|-|that you caused cause i was so traumatized|-|felt like i was in for a long bus ride|-|i'd rather die than you not be by my side|-|can't count how many times i vomited, cried|-|go to my room, turn the radio on and hide|-|thought we were bonnie and clyde, nah|-|on the inside you were jekyll and hyde|-|i, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie|-|it was you and i, why did i think it was ride or die?|-|cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda|-|it's like you put a, knife through my chest|-|and pushed it right through to the, other side|-|of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda|-|put up more of a fight, but i couldn't|-|at the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda|-|take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?|-|bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer|-|cause this morning i finally stood up|-|held my chin up, finally showed a sign|-|of life in me for the, first time since you left me|-|and left me with nothing but shattered dreams|-|and the life we coulda, had and we could've been|-|but i'm breaking out of this slump i'm in|-|pulling myself out of the dumps once again|-|i'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit|-|i'ma be late for the pity party|-|but you're

i put 'em in a verse to lay|-|and i thank you cause you made me a better person than i was|-|but i hate you cause you drained me, i gave you all, you gave me none|-|but if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done|-|i'm still angry, yeah, i may be, i may never trust someone|-|but you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than i was|-|before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you|-|and if i stumble, i won't crumble, i'll get back up and uhh|-|but i'mma still be humble when i scream "fuck you"|-|cause i'm stronger than i wasnani own a mansion but live in a

game of|-|wait dinner at eight|-|i have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of|-|love, love, love, love|-|l-l, l-l-l-lovemom, i know i let you down|-|and though you say the days are happy|-|why is the power off, and i'm fucked up?|-|and mom, i know he's not around|-|but don't you place the blame on me|-|as you pour yourself another drink|-|i guess we are who we are|-|headlights shining in the dark night i drive on|-|maybe we took this too far|-|i went in headfirst|-|never thinking about who what i said hurt, in what verse|-|my mom probably got it the worst|-|the brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are|-|did i take it too far?|-|cleaning out my closet and all them other songs|-|but regardless i don't hate you cause ma!|-|you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom|-|though far be it for you to be calling, my house was vietnam|-|desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb|-|equivalent to chemical warfare|-|and forever we can drag this on and on|-|but, agree to disagree|-|that gift from me up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me|-|you're kicking me out? it's 15 degrees and it's christmas eve|-|(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat|-|anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats?|-|especially when dad, he fucked us both|-|we're in the same fucking boat|-|you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)|-|further away that drove us, but together headlights shine|-|a car full of belongings|-|still got a ways to go|-|back to grandma's house it's straight up the road|-|and i was the man of the house, the oldest|-|so my shoulders carried the weight of the load|-|then nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and|-|that's when i realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable|-|and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though, but|-|i guess we are who we are|-|headlights shining in the dark night i drive on|-|maybe we took this too far|-|cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though|-|cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth|-|but i'm sorry mama for cleaning out my closet, at the time i was angry|-|rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause|-|now i know it's not your fault, and i'm not making jokes|-|that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time it's on the radio|-|and i think of nathan being placed in a home|-|and all the medicine you fed us|-|and how i just wanted you to taste your own, but|-|now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow|-|and i'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though|-|but ma, i forgive you, so does nathan yo|-|all you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both|-|foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours|-|but i love you debbie mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause|-|one thing i never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was|-|fuck it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address|-|but i'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus|-|own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas|-|someone ever moved them from me? that you could bet your ass's|-|if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa, kidnap them|-|and although one has only met their grandma|-|once you pulled up in our drive one night|-|as we were leaving to get some hamburgers|-|me, her and nate, we introduced you, hugged you|-|and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me|-|as we pulled off to go our separate paths, and|-|i saw your headlights as i looked back|-|and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad|-|so mom, please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet|-|i guess i had to get this off my chest|-|i hope i get the chance to lay it fore i'm dead|-|the stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, i guess we're crashing|-|so if i'm not dreaming, i hope you get this message|-|that i'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama...|-|i guess we are who we are|-|headlights shining in the dark night i drive on|-|maybe we took this too far|-|i want a new life, (start over)|-|one without a cause (clean slate)|-|so i'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost|-|and if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up|-|well, just know that i'm alright, i was not afraid to die|-|oh, even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me|-|just know that i'm alright, i was not afraid to die|-|because i put my faith in my little girls, so i never say goodbye cruel world|-|just know that i'm alright, i am not afraid to die|-|i guess we are who we are|-|headlights shining in the dark night i drive on|-|maybe we took this too far|-|i want a new lifeyeah, trying to figure out the difference|-|but i think|-|i think the lines are starting to get blurred|-|i'm in a strange place|-|i feel like ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith|-|i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints|-|grimming every stranger in the place while i gaze into space|-|'cause i'm mentally rearranging his face|-|i need a change of pace 'cause the pace i'm working at is dangerous|-|there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst|-|i done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em|-|'cause that's where most of my anger is baste|-|fuck your feelings, i feel like i play for the saints|-|i just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks|-|then aim for all these fake kanyes, jays, waynes and the drakes|-|i'm frustrated cause ain't no more n'sync, now i'm all out of whack|-|i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack|-|i'm going all out in this

revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches|-|to make sure i keep up with my competition|-|hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes|-|borderline genius who's bored of his lines|-|and that sort of defines|-|where i'm at|-|and the way i feel now, feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies|-|there's darkness closing in, there it goes again|-|it controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin|-|but he's just a friend, who pops up now and again|-|so don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin|-|welcome back to the land of the living, my

"go!" with their seventeen year-old uncle|-|i'm like "guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads' who got mad when i asked if they liked violence?"|-|and told me that my tape taught 'em to

worse|-|and "fuck" was the first word i ever learned|-|up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird|-|so read up, about how i used to get beat up|-|peed on, be on free lunch and change
